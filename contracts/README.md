Binis Token (BT)
The Binis Token (BT) is an ERC20 token deployed on the Ethereum blockchain. It is implemented using the OpenZeppelin library and provides basic functionalities of a standard ERC20 token along with additional ownership features.

Contract Features
Ownership: The token contract includes an Ownable abstract contract that allows for ownership management. The initial owner of the contract is set during deployment.

ERC20 Implementation: The token contract implements the standard ERC20 interface with functions for transferring tokens, checking balances, and approving token transfers.

Minting Tokens: The contract includes a constructor that mints 50 TT tokens to the deployer's address upon deployment.

Events
The contract emits the following events:

OwnershipTransferred: Emits when ownership of the contract is transferred to a new address. Includes the previous owner's address and the new owner's address.

Transfer: Emits when tokens are transferred from one account to another. Includes the sender's address, the recipient's address, and the amount of tokens transferred.

Approval: Emits when approval is granted for one address to spend tokens on behalf of another address. Includes the owner's address, the spender's address, and the approved token amount.

Usage
The Binis Token can be used for various purposes such as incentivizing users, governance voting, or as a medium of exchange within a decentralized application (DApp) ecosystem.


Explanation of _transfer:

This function is responsible for transferring tokens from one address to another.
It first checks that neither the sender nor the receiver is the zero address.
Then, it checks if the sender has enough tokens to send and updates the balances accordingly.
It emits a Transfer event to log the transfer.


Explanation of _mint:

This function mints new tokens and assigns them to the specified account.
It checks that the account is not the zero address.
It increases the total supply of tokens and updates the balance of the account.
It emits a Transfer event to log the minting.


Explanation of _burn:

This function burns a specific amount of tokens from the specified account.
It checks that the account is not the zero address and has enough tokens to burn.
It decreases the total supply of tokens and updates the balance of the account.
It emits a Transfer event to log the burning.



Explanation of _approve:

This function sets the allowance for a spender to spend tokens on behalf of the owner.
It checks that neither the owner nor the spender is the zero address.
It updates the allowance mapping and emits an Approval event.



Explanation of _spendAllowance:

This internal function is used to spend an allowance of tokens.
It checks that the current allowance is sufficient for the spender to spend.
It reduces the allowance after the spending is done.
